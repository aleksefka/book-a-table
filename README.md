# Little Lemon's Restaurant - Demo Project

This is a capstone project for the ["Meta Front-End Developer Specialization" on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/meta-front-end-developer).

The task was to setup a website with a table booking system for a fictitious restaurant named 'Little Lemon'. This project was mainly realised with following tools:

- [Figma](https://www.figma.com) for design
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) as programming language
- [React](https://react.dev/) as framework
- [Chakra UI](https://www.chakra-ui.com/) as component library
- [Vite](https://vite.dev/) as a build tool
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [Testing-Library](https://testing-library.com/) for testing

Additional tools and little helpers I used during development have been the following among others (maybe you'll find them helpful, too):

- [Favicon.ico Generator](https://www.favicon.cc/)
- TBD

## Quickstart - How to Setup and Start the App?

1. Download the project from [my GitHub repository](https://github.com/aleksefka/book-a-table)
2. Locally on your machine, open a terminal and navigate to the project root
3. Use `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies
4. Then use `npm run dev` to get the app up and running.
5. Open a browser on `http://localhost:5173`. If this does not work, check if your system used a different port (see console output).
